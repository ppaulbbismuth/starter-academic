abstract: This platform is an open source meccanum vehicle. Meccanum wheels allow ilo to have 3 real degree of freedom on the ground. The robot is firstly build for educative purpose such as *discovery of programming* and the *notion of ten* in elementary school. As an open-source platform, it is also possible to use it for any other robotic project.

# Summary. An optional shortened abstract.
summary: ilo is platform firstly developed to enable algorithmic developement at elementary school. It is programmable with the easiest way, simply taking photo of the planned path.

#### System Architecture

The robot embeds common and open source components to be easily made.

#### Mechanical Design

As the project aims to be open source, we try to make the robot fully 3D printable. [Here]("https://github.com/jumellet/ilo-bot/tree/main/parts") can be found the differnet parts.

#### Elementary Programming

It is now our goal to propose introduction of algorithms from the youngest age. We provide an easy way to learn how to structure computer code and execute it.
