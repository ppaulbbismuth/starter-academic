This personal portfolio presents different projects on which I worked during my Master of Science.

#### Research Vision

In my research I aim to accelerate the era of autonomy defined by highly manoeuvrable robots, extremely reliable and minimally invasive for the environment.
  
To achieve this, my goal is to revolutionize reliability by learning robots with increased senses for safety, performance and super-human abilities.
